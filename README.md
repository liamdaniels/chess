It's chess! 
So far I have 2 greedy algs that it can play: random move (lol) and fewest 
opponent moves but I'll be adding more if I don't get bored.

If you want to compile and run the code, please use the extra sdl file in my other repository called my_C_util. Also you will need SDL2 and SDL2_image.
